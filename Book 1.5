JULY 2013.
Reid.
Asher fucking Huntzburger. Again.
This summer sucked. I spent it watching Raven and Asher make googly
eyes at one another during these stupid parties. I wanted to punch the fucker
in the face. Rip his limbs out of his stupid body and rearrange them. Give
him hands for legs and legs for hands. I’d like to see him make a move on
her, then.
She wanted him again. I could tell by how they were eye fucking each other
from across the room. If she snuck away with him again… I couldn’t stand
here and do nothing.
I can tell on her. I shouldn’t, but I could tell Ajax that Raven was sneaking
around to make out with Asher. Raven was fifteen, and Asher was at least
eighteen. Ajax would have a field day with that. He would kick Asher’s
sorry little butt. Asher would never be invited to Ajax’s parties again; if I
never had to see Asher’s face, that was perfectly fine.
Hell, I could beat him up myself. This was exactly why I wanted to work
out with Ajax. So I could Kick. Asher’s. Ass.
Unfortunately, I couldn’t do any of those things. I couldn’t beat up Asher
without risking Raven asking some serious questions about our relationship,
or lack thereof.
I couldn’t tell on her either. She’d hate me if she found out I tarnished her
name in front of her precious Ajax. Lord forbid if someone were to ruin her
perfect track record in front of him.
Leave it to Raven to be obsessed with every male in the world except me. It
was one thing to hate Asher fucking Huntzburger, but hating my own
brother was low. Well, hate might be a strong word, but since Raven moved
to New York, I strongly disliked Ajax.
I, of all people, should know what she wanted, but part of knowing Raven
was understanding she was impossible to read romantically.
At least I had another target tonight other than my goddamn brother.
Fucking Asher Huntzburger. I could go back to wanting him dead.
I tried fucking with his head. I told Asher that Raven was fifteen and had no
experience with men. The asshole didn’t care. None of these fuckers cared.
Men were always fascinated with Raven because she was abnormal. Yes, a
weird reason to find a girl attractive, but it was true.
Raven wasn’t boy-crazy. They couldn’t get a read on her or figure her out.
That’s why they were attracted to her—she was mysterious.
Men fawned over Raven. Hell, I fawned over Raven, and she fawned over
Ajax.
And now Asher fucking Huntzburger.
God. I hated that stupid asshole and his stupid, pretentious assholey name.
Why the hell were we friends with him? I knew he wanted her. I could see it
in his greedy, little beady eyes. When Ajax first let us attend these parties, I
found Asher laser-focused on Raven.
I couldn’t compete with Asher or Ajax. They were older, authoritative
figures, and if anyone had a daddy complex, it was Raven.
I dropped hints to show her what she meant to me, but Raven would never
acknowledge it unless she was ready to see romance. Many people lacked
emotional intelligence; Raven lacked romantic intelligence. She had no clue
of the effect she had on men. The only semi-romantic interest she had
displayed was for Ajax, and even that was confusing. Half the time, I
couldn’t pinpoint if it was sisterly affection or a romantic crush.
It wasn’t Ajax’s fault Raven followed him around like his lost puppy, but I
didn’t know where else to direct this anger and jealousy. I couldn’t direct it
toward Raven. Never.
At least Ajax had no interest in Raven. She could want him with all her
might; Ajax would never see her as anything more than his little sister, like
Mia.
Maybe that’s why she wanted him so badly. Ajax didn’t pay her attention
and strutted around with other women. I should do the same so she’d want
me, too.
It wasn’t Ajax or Asher’s fault. This was my doing. I was the one who
pushed Ajax to let us come to these parties. Raven and I weren’t allowed to
do most things without Ajax’s supervision, and I wanted to show her a good
time. I was the one who told Raven that we needed to make a pact. We
should try our first kisses together by the end of freshman year.
I meant with each other.
Instead, she asked me who I wanted to kiss and twisted the knife when she
informed me of her plans to kiss Asher. Leave it to Raven to dismiss or
misinterpret every single thing I said. Why was it so hard for her to see me
in that light?
I held off kissing anyone else because of her and kept waiting for her to be
ready. Little did I understand what she had in mind.
I’d had to watch her make moves on Ash all summer. After the first time I
saw them together, I got shit-faced, hooked up with some girl, and passed
out on the street. It was a bad night. Since then, it had been a rotating door.
Every time we had one of these parties, I had to see her with Asher. Every
time I did, I drowned in alcohol and hooked up with the closest warm body.
I went a little further with one of those girls each time, hoping to spark
Raven’s jealousy somehow. Hoping somehow it’d make everything better.
It didn’t.
Last month, I got my first blow job.
It happened right after I saw Raven’s mouth plastered to Asher’s. I wanted
to go over and rip him into pieces. One of my groupies—as Raven called
them—intervened, looking for attention.
So, instead of having my fist make contact with Asher’s stupid face, I went
upstairs to get a blow job. She was older and had no problem going further.
I just couldn’t.
I held out on having sex, hoping Raven would come around.
Instead, I stood like an idiot with our friends, watching them stare at each
other. She wasn’t done with him. Obviously, he wasn’t done with her,
either. Asher looked smitten with Raven and gave her the signal to meet
him outside.
As predicted, Asher walked out, with Raven following closely after,
presumably to go to their meet-up spot and make out some more.
Rage burnt through me at such an accelerated speed that my legs moved
faster than my mind. Slamming my drink down, I broke away from the
group and scattered to the door.
“Reid, where are you going?” Some drunk girl came over to hang around
my neck. What was her name? Andrea or Amy. Something with an A.
“Just going out for air.” I pulled her off of me.
“I’ll come with you.”
“No.”
Stumbling outside of the house, I searched the empty streets. They
disappeared into thin air, but I couldn’t sit around and do nothing. Not
again.
Raven didn’t pick up when I called her phone, so I texted her instead.
Hey, where did you run off to?
No response. I was going out of my mind, acting like a crazy motherfucker,
but she couldn’t be with him. This had to stop.
There was a trail and a park nearby. Those were the only two places they
could have gone for privacy at this time of the night. I checked the trail
first. Nothing. Next, I walked to the nearby park and located two lone
figures sitting on the swing set. Raven and Asher.
Thank God they weren’t kissing, so I didn’t have to kill Asher. They were
merely talking. Walking toward them casually, I did my best to suppress my
rage.
“Hey, guys.”
Raven and Asher whipped their heads in apparent shock.
“Umm… hey, Stud.” Raven plastered on a confused smile, trying to read
me with her questioning eyes and asking why the hell I was clit-blocking
her.
“Hey man, what’s going on?” Asher eyed me apprehensively as well.
What’s going on is you are sitting here with a fifteen-year-old girl, you
fucking pedophile. Get away from her and never look at her again with your
beady eyes.
Biting my tongue, I did my best to keep my cool. Ajax recently enrolled me
in therapy to work on my anger issues. As always, Ajax went into Mr. Fix-it
mode. He wanted to fix everything and everyone, including me. He was
such a fucker. I was going to beat him up, too, just like Asher.
Okay, perhaps my anger was out of control, which wasn’t productive at the
moment.
“Raven’s been missing from the party for a while,” I said evenly.
“Oh… umm,” Raven started with her usual stammering, which meant she
was baffled.
“We’ll be right there,” Asher solidified her plans on her behalf.
My fists clenched on their own. There was no we. There was only Raven
and me. That’s the only time there was a ‘we,’ but I couldn’t say that either.
There was only one surefire way to get Raven’s attention. “Ajax was asking
about her. I didn’t want him coming out and looking for Raven.” I tilted my
head pointedly toward Asher.
“Shit.” Raven jumped before Asher could form another word in his thick
skull. Fucking predictable.
“Rave, it’s not that big of a deal—” Asher started.
“Yes, it is,” Raven and I both said in unison.
“Ash, I’ll text you later. I gotta go.” Raven hurried toward the path leading
to the house.
“Raven!” Asher called out as he jumped to his feet to follow her.
“Listen, man,” I blocked his path, keeping his horny dick away from her.
“You might not care about Ajax finding out, but I know Raven does. Ajax is
already freaking out. If you go after her right now, it’ll stress her out more.”
“I’m going to walk her home, at least. It’s close to midni—”
“I’ll walk her home,” I cut him off. “Ajax won’t be angry if he thinks we
went for a walk, but if he finds out you were with her at this hour, it’ll be
bad for Raven. Trust me.”
I could see his hesitation, deciding between the chivalry of walking Raven
home or risking getting caught. He knew—as well as I did—that every man
was a consolation prize in Raven's eyes, second best only to Ajax. If Ajax
got wind of it, Raven would dump Asher’s sorry ass in a heartbeat.
Asher thought with his dick instead of his moral code. “Okay, fine. You
walk her home.” He cocked his head at Raven’s quickly descending figure.
“Rave, text me when you get home. Stay with Reid.”
“Will do.” Raven didn’t bother turning around to acknowledge him.
I quickened my pace to catch up to Raven. Out of the corner of my eyes, I
saw Asher’s retreating figure in the opposite direction.
“Is Ajax pissed?” Raven said as I fell into step next to her.
“Huh?”
“Ajax! You said he was looking for me. Is he pissed?”
I already forgot about the white lie. Ajax did ask about Raven, but earlier in
the night. Not when I left to find her.
“Oh, right. He is fine. We couldn’t find you at the party, and you didn’t
answer my calls. I guess you were having too much fun.” I failed to keep
the disdain out of my voice.
“Oh, sorry. I totally spaced.”
We were both quiet for a few minutes. Grabbing her hand, I entwined it
with mine as we made our way back. “Rave, I don’t care for Asher,” I broke
the silence lingering between us.
“What?”
“I. Don’t. Care. For. Asher.” I enunciated each word as if it would mean
more if I did.
“Why?”
“Because he is eighteen, pursuing a fifteen-year-old.” There were plenty of
women who were his age. Why didn’t he pursue one of them?
“He doesn’t know I am fifteen,” Raven protested. “Everyone assumed I was
seventeen, and I didn’t correct them.”
Asher did know she was fifteen, which made him a creep, but I didn’t
bother disclosing it to Raven. It would end in a massive fight if she found
out I told him. It might make Asher look bad, but not enough to win me
points.
“Still. Before we started attending these parties, Ajax told the guys they
were never allowed to pursue you or Mia. Asher knows Ajax will kill him if
you two are caught and is putting you in a bad position as well. Ajax will be
pissed at you, too.”
“I know,” Raven sighed in defeat. “But you were the one who kept saying
we needed to experience our firsts together. I wasn’t going to leave you
hanging on our deal. All the boys in our class are so lame. Where the hell
was I supposed to meet someone interesting if not through one of Ajax’s
parties?”
I. Hated. My. Life.
I did this; I shot myself in the foot. “Rave, it was stupid to think we needed
to experience our first kisses by the end of freshman year. Just forget about
it. Asher is not good enough for you. He should have never been your first
kiss.”
“Ugh. You don’t think anyone is good enough for me.”
“Damn right.” It’s true. No one was good enough or deserving of her, and
there were so many of them. My stomach was tied in knots as I thought of
the men I had to compete with. One day at a time. One asshole at a time. In
the meanwhile, I could remind her of the risk with Asher until it got through
to her, and she moved on.
Right on cue, Raven spoke without provocation. “Ash is sweet. I like him
but not enough to pick a fight with Ajax,” Raven concluded.
“I think that’s a mature decision. He isn’t worth it.”
“Har har.”
We walked to the house in a comfortable silence as I contemplated how to
get all of them out of her system until she only saw me, the same way I only
saw her.
Raven and I had been in Paris for most of the summer. Raven
arrived in May to help Theressa set up her shop, and I joined her in midsummer. I was excited to be in Europe with her, just us two, without New
York City distractions.
No Ajax. No one from our infamous parties, and no way for her to meet
older men through Ajax’s friend group. I thought everything would change
for the better.
Raven and I finally discussed her obsession with Ajax at our seventeenth
birthday party, and it clicked. Raven wasn’t in love with Ajax. It was
merely her usual obsession with pleasing parental figures. She was such a
teacher’s pet.
After I explained how her behavior appeared to others, Raven had no
problem distancing herself from Ajax. She had barely contacted him this
summer. I should feel guilty for sabotaging their relationship, but I didn't.
Raven wasn’t distracted by Ajax anymore, and I had her all to myself again.
I wanted to beef up before seeing Raven again. Plus, Ajax seemed
frustrated over the summer with his new business. Before coming to Paris,
we went on a stricter gym regimen than before. We bulked up significantly.
Ajax and I had always fared well with the female demographic, but by the
time I left for Paris, every chick in our vicinity threw themselves at us.
Yet, I refrained.
In the past, I’d had my share of sexual experiences, but I never went all the
way. Ajax and Raven thought I was actively having sex, but I kept holding
out. Kept waiting pathetically for her. It was such a pussy thing to do,
especially for a horny teenager.
In the back of my miserably hopeful mind, I hoped Raven would wake up
and see me. If there was one thing I wanted to share with Raven, it was our
first time.
After my conversation with Raven at the birthday party and after receiving
the all-clear she wasn’t into Ajax, I thought about telling her how I felt over
the summer. We were going to spend the summer in Paris. I thought this
summer we could finally… ugh.
I ignored all the other girls until coming to Paris, only to find her with a
boyfriend.
Are you fucking kidding me!?
Raven was dating some asshole named Michelle. What kind of name was
that, anyway?
At least I never had to see her actively date someone before. Not like this.
She added the douchebag as her plus-one to our plans and called him her
fucking boyfriend. I wanted to choke the living shit out of him more than I
wanted to with Asher or Ajax. That’s what I had to do. I had to kill off the
entire male population before Raven noticed me.
Even then, she might say some stupid shit like, you are my brother from
another mother.
God, I hated those words. I cringed and shut down every time she said them
to me.
When would this torture end? Why did God make me love such a crazy
woman?
Not only was she dating Michelle in front of me, but they were getting
physical. Raven didn’t share details as she was notoriously private about
some things, even with me. I knew she was going further with him than any
guy before. I kept hoping, for my sanity, it wasn’t the case.
It was getting harder to live in denial.
We went to a club not long ago, and she left with Michelle, texting me to
say she was leaving. Before I could run out of the club to stop her, they
were gone. I kept calling her, but her phone was turned off.
She didn’t come home until the following day.
This was so much worse than when I thought she liked Ajax. Now I wished
she was interested in Ajax instead. At least she never had a shot with Ajax.
Now she was fucking this Michelle and asking me all kinds of sex
questions. We sometimes watched porn as a joke, but recently I could tell
she was taking mental notes. She was trying to gain experience and ideas to
try with him.
I couldn’t take it anymore.
I had also started fucking. I no longer gave two shits about this romantic
crap and waiting for her. I couldn’t remember the name of the first girl I
slept with. I went from zero to way too many within a couple of months.
You would think something like that would make a seventeen-year-old feel
better.
It didn’t, which was why I had to talk to her.
I fidgeted in front of her door, contemplating whether I should knock or
casually walk in like I always did. I decided on the latter.
I swung the door open and found Raven stretched out on her stomach on the
bed, flipping through a magazine. God, she was so beautiful. Did she know
how beautiful she was?
What was I going to say? Right.
“I don’t like him,” I declared. Not exactly how I intended to start the
conversation but there—it was out and in the open.
“You don’t like whom?” Raven burrowed her eyebrows.
Damnit. I needed to practice my spiel.
“Michelle.”
“It’s Michel.”
“I don’t like him.”
“He is sweet.”
“And you have a sweet tooth though we both know it’s bad for you.”
Raven stared at me for a moment, then burst out laughing. I didn’t join in,
wanting to establish I was serious.
“You are serious. What’s your problem with Michel anyways?”
“He is too old for you,” I said with my arms crossed.
“He is only four years older than me.”
“That’s too old.”
“Stop. You and Ajax never think any boy is good enough for me.”
Raven sat on the bed, crossing her legs. I joined her on the bed and
mimicked her position. I sat across from her so she could see the sincerity
in my eyes.
“Because they are not. Do you actually like him?” I held my breath as I
awaited her response.
“He is cool. I enjoy his company.”
“He is a total creep for chasing someone so much younger than him. Not to
mention, we are returning to New York soon. It makes no sense to let him
get attached to you.”
“You think?”
“Yes,” I asserted. “He is all over you. It’s best if you end it now before it
gets messier.”
“Hmm… good point, as always. I’ll think about it.”
“What is there to think about?” I didn’t get it. All I was asking was for her
to break up with this douchebag. Why wouldn’t Raven be reasonable?
“Well, I might return to Paris. It’d be nice to have a ready-made boyfriend
in that case.”
“What?” I couldn’t keep the hurt out of my voice. “You are moving to
Paris. Since when?” She was going to leave me? She didn’t so much as
discuss it.
“Well, the Paris School of Fashion has a great program, and Mom is finally
settled in one city instead of traveling all the time. If I do my undergraduate
in Paris, I’ll get to live in the fashion capital of the world. They do noncredit semester internships. I’m almost done at Wellington with my core
classes. So, I can do a remote internship for my last semester to see if I like
it here. Call it a test trial.” She must have noticed the disdain on my face
because she quickly added, “It’s just an idea. An additional option.”
“And FIT?” I could barely keep my voice steady.
“Another great option.”
I couldn’t form words, so I remained quiet. Raven and I always talked about
her attending the Fashion Institute of Technology while I attended New
York University and possibly getting an apartment together. After my
undergraduate, I wanted to work for Wall Street, and she wanted to be in
fashion. New York was an excellent option for Raven’s career, but Paris
wasn’t a great option for me.
“Okay, I’ll apply with you,” I spoke without thinking.
“To Paris School of Fashion?”
I rolled my eyes. “No, stupid. I’ll find a school in Paris for Econ or Finance
and apply there. What the hell does it matter if we go to school in New York
or Paris?”
“Why would you do that?”
“Where else would I be if not with you?”
Before I could say more, Raven jumped in my arms. I laughed as I almost
tipped backward in my attempt to catch her. A little too soon, Raven pulled
back.
After a few minutes, Raven asked, “You’d do that for me?”
Should I tell her now?
For years, I watched her swoon over Ajax. It ripped my insides. I hooked up
with chick after chick, hoping for some sort of reaction or jealousy.
Nothing. I came to Paris for her, only to find out she had a boyfriend. I was
so choked up I could barely speak when she sprung him on me. I went
through woman after woman. This time I wasn’t trying to make her jealous;
I sought comfort and distraction.
I was done with those mind-fuck games. I was nothing without her. Half of
me was always missing when we weren’t together. I couldn’t be in New
York if Raven weren’t there.
“Everyone tells us we have an unhealthy codependency on each other.
Might as well prove them right,” I said, mentally gearing myself for the
upcoming heavy conversation.
“Then let’s stay in New York,” Raven proclaimed.
“Really?”
“Yes.”
“I thought you were sold on the idea of moving to the fashion capital of the
world.” I raised an eyebrow at Raven.
“I wasn’t sold. It was an idea, but as I think about it, it was a bad idea. I can
be a successful designer in either New York or Paris. You can’t successfully
run Wall Street if you aren’t physically near Wall Street, and us living on
two different continents will never work. I can’t function without you.”
This was it. It was now or never. Before I could open my mouth, Raven
sighed dramatically.
“What can I say? You are my,” —don’t say it, Raven— “brother from
another mother.”
MOTHERFUCKER!
The party had only begun, and I was already exhausted.
Ajax always threw Raven and me lavish parties for our birthdays. So, we
decided to return the favor and throw Ajax a grand twenty-first birthday
party.
Raven had outdone herself with the decorations, and Asher had overdone it
with cases and beer and liquor. I had been running around all day, tying up
loose ends and helping the vendors unload in the house. We had a caterer,
servers, and various party activities Ajax liked. Raven and I had saved for
months to throw him this party.
We began the night with a family dinner at a restaurant. Afterward, the
parents went off to stay at the Plaza and took Mia with them so we could
have the house.
Now that our last task was done, which was to bring Ajax here for the big
reveal, Raven and I were focused on drinking and hanging out with our
friends. We invited our small clique of friends to keep ourselves entertained.
Ajax had way too many friends. The house was packed, so we decided to let
most of his friends party inside the house while the ‘youngins’ gathered
outside by the back patio, enjoying the cool November weather. A few
people were also on the street across from the house, enjoying a cigarette or
two. I didn’t smoke anymore, but I walked toward the guys huddled in a
circle.
“You got a lighter?” Sam asked as soon as I joined them. We attended the
same school, and he was one of my core boys.
“Nah. I gave up smoking,” I replied.
“Since when?” Jon, Sam’s older brother, piped in. He frowned at me
suspiciously.
“Since I realized it’ll kill me, and I enjoy being alive.” And since Raven
continually threw away every single pack I bought. She finally threatened
not to speak to me if I didn’t quit.
“All right, your highness, no need to be so prissy.” Asher threw both hands
in the air and mimicked me.
I rolled my eyes, grinning nonetheless.
Asher Huntzburger, always the comic. I hated Asher’s guts not too long ago
for holding Raven’s attention. I sometimes shook my head, thinking of how
much I used to loathe him. After all, it wasn’t his fault. What man could
resist it when Raven Beckett threw you a bone?
Once I realized Raven was over Asher and he could do nothing to change
her mind, my anger turned into pity. It was pathetic watching him vie for
her attention. Guess I saw something of myself in him. Over the years,
commiseration turned into a camaraderie of sorts. Now, I kind of liked
Asher. He was a good guy but under the Raven spell. If anyone could
empathize, it was me.
I turned my head slightly to stare at Raven by the patio door. She was
talking to Natalie and looking unbelievably gorgeous, as usual.
Asher followed my gaze, his eyes landing on her as well. Neither of us
spoke as we stared at her. Her long, dark hair flew everywhere. Her dress
showed just the right amount of skin, and the heels propped her ass up.
Honestly, it was torture for any man to watch her.
Other men wanted her because they couldn’t have her. Men were truly like
dogs. If a woman ignored a man, he pursued her more. The chase was the
allure. We wanted what we couldn’t have.
There were other beautiful women in the world, but they couldn’t keep a
man’s attention when they acted desperately. It wasn’t about looks. Instead,
it was about how you carried yourself. I learned these things from years of
observation and concluded that was the reason so many men wanted Raven.
However, it wasn’t why I wanted Raven.
I wanted her because we had a bond unparalleled by anything else in this
world. We shared every memory, good and bad. Since we learned to speak,
not a single day had gone by when we didn’t talk to one another. I wanted
her because she was the only girl who could make my heart beat a million
times within the same second.
Most of all, I wanted Raven because there was something so special about
the way she loved. Once you earned her love, it was no holds barred. She’d
do anything for those she loved.
If I got sick, Raven never left my side. When I gave up smoking, Raven was
glued to me to ensure I didn't fall off the wagon. When her dad opened a
debit card for Raven, she automatically put my name on the account
because I didn’t have one.
The small things she did for the people she loved were why I wanted her.
That wasn’t why Asher wanted her. He wanted her because he couldn’t
have her.
“Hey, I’ll be right back,” Asher said.
“Sure,” I nodded.
He was going over to hit on Raven, which used to bother me. I used to want
him dead every time he looked at Raven.
Not anymore.
I’d be angry if it weren’t so pathetic to watch. It was too sad, like the
Titanic going down.
I wanted to tell him to move on, but I had no leg to stand on. If anyone
needed a lesson on how to move on from Raven Beckett, it was me. It had
only been, what, seventeen years? I hadn’t moved on, not a smidge. If there
were a switch to turn it off, I would have used it by now.
As much as I loved Raven, I stopped pursuing her since Paris. Raven was
finally interested in dating, but she chose someone else to date. After she
broke things off with Michelle, I thought we could talk. Instead, she left my
ass in Paris via text and abruptly flew to New York.
I could be in love with her until my dying breath, and it would change
nothing. We needed distance, and I’d created some since our return from
Paris. For example, I didn’t go to her room or hang out with her all the time.
I went out with my boys, while Raven often stayed home. I was unsure if
she noticed. There was no point in pursuing her. Raven wanted someone
older. Since I was born an hour before her, it was one thing I could never
change.
She’d always be my best friend, and that’s it. I should be grateful she hadn’t
dated since our return.
As for myself, I had been swimming in women and drinking copious
amounts of alcohol. It helped. Somewhat.
Like tonight. I had been talking to the chick who was strutting toward us.
She was older, experienced, in college, and perfect to bury myself in for the
night.
What did she say her name was? Juli, July, or Jules? I racked my brain as
Juli/July/Jules joined me. “Should we go back to my dorm?”
“Yup. Let me just shoot my brother a text.” I pulled out my phone to text
Ajax I was leaving.
“Okay. I am going to grab my purse and say bye to my friend. Give me like
ten minutes.”
“Sounds good.” I gave her the Sinclair megawatt smile.
See? Moving on instead of crying over the girl who’d never love me back,
unlike Asher over there.
I glanced over at Asher and Raven. It was hard to watch him grovel at her
feet, and I was glad for not pathetically chasing after her anymore. Paris had
given me a much-needed slap in the face.
Asher lunged at Raven just as the thought crossed my mind, grabbing her
for a lip lock.
What the fuckity fuck?
All the pity for Asher was gone, not after he put his grimy hands on Raven.
I was across the street from the house. I was about to rush over, ready to
tear Asher from limb to limb when Ajax’s unmistakable figure tackled
Asher to the ground. Ajax appeared insane, landing punch after punch.
Holy shit. Ajax might kill the motherfucker.
I broke into a run, but Raven had already thrown herself at Ajax, hugging
him from the front and screaming. Ajax grabbed Raven by the elbow and
dragged her inside before I made it back. My first instinct was to check on
Raven, but it looked like Ajax got her. Instead, I went to Asher. I wanted to
kill him, but Ajax might have beat me to the cause.
Fuck. Asher looked terrible, and there was blood everywhere. I thought I
was the hot-tempered one, but Ajax had lost his mind. My brother might go
to jail tonight. I had to take charge and clean up his mess.
I directed Sam and Jon to help me carry Asher. Our friends, Dennie and
Ulysses, grabbed the first aid kit and towels. Janeen went inside to find
Amy, one of our family friends. She was a nurse and, luckily, still coherent.
Amy put on her nurse’s hat and cleaned Asher’s wounds before applying
butterfly stitches. Our friends frantically ran around, helping however they
could. There was also a crowd forming around them.
This was bad. We had a lot of family friends here, and they might blab to
their parents, who were friends with our parents. That was the last thing we
needed.
“Hey, guys. I need everyone to go inside,” I announced. “We had a small
accident, but everything is fine now. Amy is on it, so go inside and enjoy
the party.”
People cleared out and returned to the party. We didn’t need more witnesses
to Ajax’s crazy outburst. I prayed Asher didn’t have to go to the hospital. A
hospital visit would mean an incident report and charges against Ajax. What
the hell overcame him, anyways? He had always been even-tempered. Yes,
I wanted to kill Asher, too, but for a different reason than out of brotherly
love for Raven. What Ajax did was past protective brotherly instincts. It
verged on jealous boyfriend territory. Those were my initial instincts but
watching Asher’s sorry ass on the ground reminded me of why I pitied him.
I froze.
What Ajax did was absolutely in the jealous boyfriend territory.
There was no way… it couldn’t be true. I was wrong in my assessment; I
had to be.
I couldn’t sit around with these thoughts churning in my mind. After
speaking with Amy, I confirmed Asher didn’t need to go to the hospital. He
wouldn’t press charges against Ajax otherwise because Asher knew he
fucked up. I excused myself, my mind reeling from the insane conclusion. I
kept repeating in my head that I was delusional and reading too much into
it.
Where the hell did Ajax and Raven run off to anyway?
I searched the party, room by room. There was no sign of Ajax or Raven.
Finally, I made my way upstairs to check Raven’s room. Nothing. Instead, I
made my way to Ajax’s room.
The door was shut.
Bile rose in the back of my throat as the horrendous possibility became
more and more real. I stood there for God knew how long, staring at the
locked door. I had a master key to the house. It unlocked every door, but I
had never used it before. Steadily, I made my way to Ajax’s door. I pulled
out my keys to find the master and turned the lock with trembling hands.
Quietly, I pushed the door open a fraction.
Sprawled out on the bed was Raven. On top of her was a naked Ajax,
fucking her like it was his last day on earth.
I always knew Raven didn’t want me, and my feelings were only met with
rejection. She constantly chose other men, and for years I wondered how
I’d get over her.
Want to know the trick to getting over the love of your life?
Watch her fuck your brother’s brains out, and it will kill all feelings inside
you resembling love. My insides were so numb that there were no feelings
left at all. Love was a feeling, so I guess problem solved.
In the back of my disgustingly optimistic mind, I had always hoped Raven
would wake up one day and realize her best friend was the love of her life.
Like in one of those chick flicks, I had hoped it would work out between us.
This scene in front of me changed those hopes. Those possibilities and
optimism were now gone, tarnished.
Raven fucked my brother. There could never be an “us” after that. She had
sealed the deal.
I should look away. I should close the door, except I didn’t.
I watched them, imprinting the image in my mind. I took mental photos.
Fuck that. I took a mental video. If my dumb-fuck mind thought of her in
that way again, like the girl I once loved, I’d reach inside for this memory.
I’d remind my heart of these images, of Ajax climaxing inside Raven as he
held her close. These images would shut down everything like it was doing
right now.
In a way, it was good this happened. I gave Raven every ounce of my heart,
and watching her fuck my brother snapped me out of it. I was finally free of
her love. There was nothing called love inside of me anymore, so now we
could be friends.
I wasn’t angry or jealous. For the first time in seventeen years, I felt
nothing. Utterly dead on the inside. My heart was hollow. Empty. Blank.
Nothingness.
It was fucking beautiful.
This was what I needed. This dose of reality.
I always thought my love for her was unconditional. It wasn’t.
This was apparently the one condition. It was the one string Raven could
have pulled to kill my love, and she did it. She pulled the trigger.
I slowly shut the door and walked downstairs. I almost ran into
Juli/July/Jules as I took the last step.
“There you are,” she smiled. “I was looking for you. Ready to head out, or
did you want to stay here longer?”
“No, let’s go. I am done.”
For the first time in my life, I truly meant it. I was so done.
Ajax.
I pushed the door open to Raven’s room and marched inside. Raven
visibly rolled her eyes at me, unimpressed by my presence.
It was fucking irritating. Raven used to do everything in her power to be
near me. Now all she did was roll her damn eyes, looking at me with
contempt, but she wasn’t getting out of this. She would talk to me, one way
or the other.
“We have to talk,” I announced.
“We don't,” Raven predictably refused to have an adult conversation.
Raven’s sarcastic attitude was on my last nerve. I clenched and unclenched
my jaw, hating how she looked at me. I wanted her to look at me like she
used to—like I was her whole damn world. Why did she refuse to look at
me that way?
The sternness was only causing the fleeting look of fear to wash over her
face. I stared at Raven for a long while in an attempt to cool off.
“I hate hurting you,” I finally muttered under my breath.
"Well, thank you for that. Now, please leave."
I winced at her tone. This wasn’t my Raven. Raven always tried to
understand the other side. "Rave, I don't want to keep pushing you, but you
refuse to talk about us. I'm losing it here."
"Ajax, go find someone else to fuck. All the girls who came over last
weekend were dying to sleep with you. Choose one of them and leave me
alone. They won't mind your horny episodes or your bipolar mood swings."
I flinched again.
My behavior was abhorrent, and I had turned the most compassionate girl
against me. Was I breaking her that much? I must be mentally incapacitated.
I closed my eyes and tried once more. "Raven, you have every reason to
hate me. I don't know what I can say to make it better. I can't. I have no
excuse for my behavior. I can only tell you that I can't live without you. I
love you. I love you so fucking much. I don't know how to make it stop. I
feel like the only way it will is if I rip my fucking heart out."
“In that case, you are doing the most heinous things in the name of love. If
you loved me so damn much, how could you do what you did?”
I quietly studied her distraught face, making my heart thud louder. I was
chained to her with invisible shackles. Yet, I was the predator, and she was
the victim. I wasn't safe for her if she truly didn’t love me. If she didn’t
believe me, she should have me locked away. “You are right. You should
tell everyone what I did. I deserve whatever punishment I get.”
Raven looked disturbed by the suggestion. “I can't do that.”
Why? Because she loved me.
Of course, she did, but Raven wouldn’t fucking admit it. This chick had
turned me inside out. If she hated what I was doing to her, why would she
deal with it if she didn’t love me? She loved me. She was just fucking crazy
and refused to admit it.
"If you’re not going to tell them, then be with me."
“Never.”
Anger seeped through me. I was fucking frustrated and on the verge of
losing my patience. She was unreasonable, and I had no idea how to reach
her.
"Rave, you're so out of touch with your emotions that you don't understand
your own feelings. You love me, but it's like you can't access that part of
yourself. Why are you doing this to yourself? Why are you doing this to
me?"
Raven shook her head, dismissing me like she always did. Predictably,
Raven used another avoidance method to walk away.
I grabbed her by the elbow before she could do the same fucking thing, and
Raven turned to slap me right across the face. “Do not fucking touch me!”
Raven roared.
“You are such a confused little girl,” I yelled back. “You don't know what
you want. You need me to tell you what you want, like always.” After all,
Raven told me she loved me, but she was young and didn’t see things
clearly. So, I had to decide for the both of us. Truth be told, we never had a
choice in the matter. We belonged together; there was nothing more to it.
It’d be unnatural otherwise, and I couldn’t fight nature any more than she
could fight her destiny.
“I don't love you. Now get off me.”
I grabbed her wrist as she tried to twist out of my hold. She couldn’t. She
couldn’t leave me. Nothing in life would make sense if we weren’t together.
She was mine in every sense of the word.
Raven screamed for me to stop. For a moment, I considered precisely that
—stopping this insanity. However, an immediate panic and unbearable
desperation took over. I couldn’t stop. Raven understood our physical
connection. It was the only time she didn’t overanalyze things.
In the snap of a moment, I was on top of her, pinning her to the floor.
“Please, baby, please don't fight me. I love you so fucking much. You are all
I ever wanted.”
Raven thrashed underneath; her shirt ripped to pieces, and buttons scattered
everywhere. Things were getting out of control. Raven looked scared, and
she was crying. I should stop, and I would have if there were another way.
We had to connect. I couldn’t breathe without her, but if she gave in,
everything would be okay again.
I desperately kissed her face and neck. Raven kept fighting me, so I pinned
her wrists on top of her head. I yanked her shorts down, shaking with my
need for her.
Barely aware of her screams and hits, I breathed into her ear, “I can't live
without you, baby. You are in my system, imprinted on my soul. Just love
me. That's all I want. I’ll make you so happy, I promise.”
I pushed two fingers inside her while biting her neck and breasts. When her
wetness coated my fingers, a huge relief washed over me. She wanted me.
I kissed her feverishly, pouring every bit of my desperation into it. I kissed
her like a maniac as I yanked my sweatpants down to slip inside her.
Sweet fucking heaven.
My home, inside my Raven.
I worked on her clit with my fingers and finally heard Raven set off.
Everything else faded away when she fell apart. We came together, with me
holding her close.
It wasn’t until I cleaned up and carried her to bed did I realize the weight of
my actions.
Raven was unresponsive, shaking uncontrollably. There were still tear
remnants on her beautiful cheeks. She was the calm before the storm. There
was a different type of anger brewing inside Raven. One that told me
nothing would be the same after this moment. She didn’t see it my way and
would never forgive me.
I had finally pushed her too far. Raven looked broken, and I had lost her for
good.
I pretended to be asleep, but my hold on her remained ironclad. Even after
losing her, and while unconscious, I’d never let her go.
The next day.
Reid.
“What do you mean by leaving?” I tilted my face at Raven.
“I mean that I am departing, exiting, going away from here,” Raven sassed
back.
I rolled my eyes. “Thanks, asshole. I know what the word leaving means,
but I don’t understand why now.”
“Why not now? I am basically done with my semester. I spoke to all my
teachers today and only have a few assignments left. They agreed to let me
email them since I got accepted to my remote internship in Paris. As long as
I complete the internship, I’ll graduate in the spring. It makes sense to leave
for Paris now so I can settle in.”
I was baffled as Raven packed her suitcase with manic speed, barely
informing me about flying to Paris within a few hours. This was sudden. I
had no idea what brought this on, but I tried to calm her down.
“Raven, you are seventeen. Don’t you need a parent or someone to buy
your ticket? I thought if you’re underage, you can’t travel unless a parent or
guardian approves it, and I doubt Ajax will approve it.”
“I don’t give two fucks what Ajax will approve of,” Raven snapped.
It became awkwardly quiet in the room. I watched her apprehensively as
she continued to pack like a beast.
I never confronted her about Ajax, nor did she know I saw them having sex.
Something terrible must have happened between them for her to make such
a quick exit.
What was I missing here?
“Did something happen between Ajax and you?” I asked quietly, unsure if I
wanted to hear the answer.
“No,” Raven said curtly.
Something bad must’ve happened between them if she was avoiding the
topic. It made me happy to hear, though I didn’t care to understand why. As
far as I was concerned, I had buried any feelings for her six feet under.
However, as her friend, I was worried.
“Rave, think about it for a second. Paris will still be there. Why not leave
after the semester is over?”
“I have already thought about it and have made my decision.”
“When?”
“Last night.”
“You made this decision last night and are putting this plan into action
tonight. You never think this emotionally. What is going on with you?”
Raven’s eyes were downcast, with a wretched expression on her face.
My newfound emotional “freedom” was immediately disturbed. I had
locked away my insufferable love for her in a coffin, buried it deep inside,
and vowed never to open the coffin. Yet, I wasn’t strong enough to watch
her be miserable.
So, I said the only thing she wanted to hear. “Rave, you don’t have to talk
about anything you don’t want to.”
“Thank you,” Raven whispered back.
“So, what’s the game plan?” I could at least make sure she was safe.
“I bought my ticket using Mom’s credit card. I’ll text her on the way to the
airport that I am coming to Paris.”
“She doesn’t know?”
“No. I don’t want her texting Ajax, but it’s okay. I have a key to her
apartment.”
Theressa might be a negligent narcissist, but she wasn’t cruel. She loved her
daughter in her own way. Raven would have a place to stay, money, and
everything else she needed. The only thing Theressa couldn’t commit to
was attention or time.
“Okay…” I said slowly. “Then what?”
“I’ll start my internship at the Paris School of Fashion in a month. I’m
going to room with a couple of the other girls from the program. They are
also from out of the country, so the school paired us in case we wanted to
lodge together. I don’t want to live with Mom, and this made the most
sense.”
“I know you talked about doing the remote internship, but I didn’t know it
was so set in stone.”
“I didn’t want to say anything until I knew if I wanted to do the remote
internship.”
I frowned. “But don’t you have to meet with your counselor to discuss your
application to FIT? Shouldn’t you at least do that before you leave?”
Raven visibly tensed. “Reid,” she said softly. “I am not going to FIT. I’m
not coming back for graduation, either. I am having them mail my diploma.
I am going to go to the Paris School of Fashion for college. I am going to
stay in Paris for good.”
I blinked.
I thought I was emotionless, that I was dead inside. One moment. One
sentence. That’s all it took.
It all returned like a hurricane. I was feeling emotions and lots of them.
And my first thought—Fuck her!
Fuck! Her!
My life, my whole fucked up mess of a life, was all her fault.
She was the reason for my complete emotional wreckage. The years of
pining after her. The years of torture. My anger. My on-and-off relationship
with my brother. The extensive mental abuse she put me through. I
wouldn’t be this broken if Raven and I weren’t born together.
The man I had become was because of this stupid notion we were destined
for each other. I could never go back. I could never be a different man
because she had already shaped my life.
I never had the opportunity to grow up without being tethered to her. The
need for her dictated every relationship and every decision in my life. I
could have been a different human being if we weren’t born together.
But we were, and she fucked me up. She bulldozed over me only to leave
me and never come back. I didn’t apply to colleges in Paris because I didn’t
think she had, either. This had nothing to do with whatever bullshit
happened between her and Ajax. This was pre-planned, and she didn’t
bother looping me in. She had no intention of us going to Paris or staying in
New York together. All the while, she led me to believe otherwise.
I spent years being angry at Ajax. I thought he was taking her away from
me, but it was never Ajax’s fault. It was Raven’s.
I confronted her about her feelings for Ajax. She said it was nothing but
brotherly love, but it wasn’t. She actively pursued him. He wasn’t aware of
how I felt about her. I never confronted him and had no right to be angry at
Ajax, but every right to be mad at her.
She lied to me, and I still looked the other way for the sake of our
friendship. I held onto the fact we were best friends with an unbreakable
bond. She couldn’t even let me hold on to that much.
All my life, I compared every woman to her. I destroyed my relationship
with Ajax over the years because of Raven. The man raised me as his own
kid, sacrificed his childhood, so I could have a better one, and all I asked
was for Raven not to be with him. She did it anyway. Now that it didn’t
work out between them, she was leaving.
She was so fucking selfish.
“Wow. You really gave me the middle finger, didn’t you? Were you going to
tell me or let me figure it out on my own?” I didn’t yell or scream. My
words were calm and disciplined.
Raven looked scared. She had never seen this fury because I had never been
this furious. Not even when I saw her fucking my goddamn brother. Every
time I thought she couldn’t do anything worse, she wrecked me once more.
“I-um Reid, I wasn’t sure about my decision—”
“We are done.”
“What?”
“We. Are. Done.” I enunciated each word.
“What do you mean by done?”
“I mean that we are finished. We are through, ended, terminated,
concluded.”
Raven rolled her eyes. “I know what the word ‘done’ means. Stop being
immature, Reid. This is—”
“Get out of my house,” I said through gritted teeth.
Raven stared at me in complete shock.
“Reid!”
“Get. Out.” I gritted out, barely able to contain my anger.
“Calm down—”
“I wish my family never took you in. I wish we left you to rot in that empty
house,” I said quietly, but she heard it because Raven gasped.
Loving her had shut down everything good inside me. So, she might as well
see the ugliness left behind. I took a step forward, my face contorting with
anger.
“No wonder your parents left you. You are toxic. You destroy everything
you touch, and now you are leaving without bothering to talk about it. I
never want to see your face. If you feel grateful for what my family did for
you, don’t contact me again. Don’t come near me. Don't reach out even if
you are lying on your deathbed or taking your last breath. I don’t want
anything to do with you. Ever.”
Your closest friends could hurt you because they mean more than strangers,
but your best friend or soulmate could hurt you better because they knew
how. I resurfaced Raven’s deepest insecurities and used her pride to wound
her. I’d never sink so low unless I wanted to end our friendship for good,
and I did. There was no turning back from this; we both knew it. So, she
remained quiet as the silent tears rolled onto her cheeks.
I didn’t care. I hated her.
If I ran into her again in this lifetime, it’d still be a lifetime too soon.
Turning on my heels, I slammed the door shut without looking back.
May 2018.
Reid.
One of the problems with ending a friendship with someone
immersed in your life was that it was never over. Not really.
I might have erased all traces of her in my life, but she still existed in other
facets. We had been friends our entire lives. Our fathers were brothers in all
but blood, and the Becketts were our closest family. We had attended the
same school and shared a friend group. Her closest friends were also my
closest friends.
We didn’t realize how interwoven our lives were until we separated.
Despite the ocean between us, dodging her had proved difficult. Plus, there
was the inconvenience of us being born on the same day.
On our my eighteenth birthday, Ajax tried to throw me a party. It was the
first year I’d celebrate a birthday without her. I was in no mood for a soiree,
and Ajax could tell by my personality shift.
In his fix-it mode, Ajax insisted on sending me and five of my friends on a
birthday trip to Mexico—all expenses paid for by Ajax. The same friends
were invited to Paris for the weekend—all expenses paid for by Theressa.
Personally, I didn’t care to celebrate. To be honest, I didn’t care for much of
anything nowadays. I never felt anything, and it was fucking great. I might
not be happy or excited, but my heart also wasn’t breaking every fucking
second of every fucking day. After years of pain and suffering, it was better
this way. No more heartbreak. No more feelings. Just obsolete and
nothingness.
I spent my days studying and my nights drinking and fucking. That was all
there was to my life. So, I backed out of my birthday plans to let her have
our friends. However, she also contacted our friend group to inform them
that she decided against celebrating her birthday. Our friends went from
having two all-expenses-paid international trips to none. The teenagers were
pissed.
The same thing happened the following year. My detached-from-life
personality exasperated Ajax, and he contacted my friends to redo the trip
from last year. Once more, the group felt awkward because Janeen wanted
everyone to go to Paris for her.
Our group consisted of privileged kids; scattered between New York, LA,
and Europe. Now that we were adults, it was customary for us to take
weekend trips for birthdays, spring break, and New Year’s Eve as an excuse
for a reunion. We were invited to the same trips but had an unspoken
understanding. If one of us RSVP’d to a trip, the other quietly backed out.
More often than not, she backed out.
I had to hand it to her. She’d never act in an un-classy way; it was beneath
her. Following her lead, I never made it an issue, though our friends picked
up on the tension. This year, they preemptively hounded us for months to
restart the tradition of celebrating our birthdays together and settled on a
neutral territory—Jaco, Costa Rica.
Was it possible for me to say no?
Absolutely. I could have said no and put my foot down.
However, somewhere in that sick, masochist mind of mine, I wanted to see
her again. I had been walking around this hollow shell of a body for too
long. There would finally be something more than hollowness if I saw her
again. I wanted to feel, so I agreed, as did she.
Our friend, Janeen, took the lead by booking the flights and a massive
Airbnb. I insisted on footing the bill for our accommodation, not wanting to
give her the upper hand. Money wasn’t much of a challenge anymore.
Growing up, we considered ourselves upper middle class, though outsiders
might have regarded us as rich. After Ajax graduated from college, he never
let us worry about money again. He created an app while in college, and as
the majority share owner of the app, he was very successful. I never asked
him for anything, but he took care of my bills, regardless.
Leave it to Ajax to make it impossible to hate him, and I didn’t. I didn’t
hate my brother for what happened with Raven. As much as I wanted to, I
was pretty sure he hated himself more. He was sullen after the whole
experience, drowning in self-loathing. My guess? He felt awful for letting it
get so far with Raven.
Ajax knew of her feelings but never encouraged her crush. He was
drowning when he had to become our parent. A lot of it was my fault. She
had a calming effect on him, admired him, and gave him unconditional
support. When he thought Raven expressed an interest in Asher, I guessed
he felt threatened about losing his support system and gave in. Obviously,
the responsible Ajax emerged after the momentary lapse in judgment. He
broke it off, which explained why Raven made such a quick exit for Paris.
The rejection wounded her pride.
I almost understood why Ajax sought her out for comfort. He relied heavily
on Raven for his sanity when he couldn’t rely on me.
What was her excuse?
She had none and fucked me over by pursuing Ajax. After shattering my
life, she up and left. Despite my numbed feelings, I could still hate her for
that.
So, this joint birthday trip wasn’t a good idea. In fact, it was a terrible one,
though it was too late to change my mind. Raven was finally in front of me
in all her glory.
Raven. I hadn’t said the name in years. I didn’t even let myself think of her
name, blanking all thoughts of her from my mind.
There was no way to avoid her or her name any longer. I came straight to
the Airbnb after my flight landed in Costa Rica. I met with the owner of the
luxurious accommodation overlooking the ocean. The door flew open as
soon as he left, with Raven standing at the door frame. She was here…
without our other friends to provide the much-needed buffer.
Janeen booked me an earlier flight than everyone else. I found it suspicious,
though she insisted I arrived earlier for my birthday surprise.
Why did I trust our friends? They were liars. They obviously had us arrive
early to hash it out.
I momentarily forgot to hate Raven as I took her in. She didn’t seem real.
She had always been stylish, but now there was a Parisian influence in her
look. Her hair was darker than before, flying all over due to the wind from
the open door. She wore a beach hat and a sundress revealing a torturous
amount of skin. Her legs were tanned, but her face was pale against her
perfectly rosy lips. She was still un-fucking-believably gorgeous though she
was a little too skinny. Her face lacked its previous glow—as if her inner
light was gone.
Who cared?
I reminded myself of all the lies and deceit. She was nothing but a pretty
face, a face that ruined me.
Raven rolled in her carry-on and shut the door behind her. We were face-toface after two and a half years apart.
“Reid,” Raven finally addressed me.
I almost gasped at the sound I hadn’t heard in so long. It squeezed my chest
so tight I couldn’t breathe or move. One word and she was already melting
the ice I had layered around my heart.
I missed her so fucking much.
“How have you been?” I asked because her state genuinely concerned me.
Raven tucked her hair behind her ear. “Good. How about you?”
“I’m fine.”
“Happy birthday.”
“To you as well.”
We stood awkwardly. Neither of us knew what to say in a situation like
ours.
Since her move, Raven had only kept in touch with Mia, my parents, and
our select group of friends. When Ajax found out Raven left for Paris, he
threw a shitstorm. He flew to Paris but returned alone. It was impossible to
read Ajax afterward, and I didn’t try. I had my own shit to deal with.
Shockingly, Mia didn’t ask, either. So, none of us offered her an
explanation.
I blamed Raven for destroying our family. In reality, she was the only one
holding us together. Despite the drama between us, Raven was the one
organizing family nights and things none of us deemed necessary. Without
her efforts, our home became suffocatingly quiet and turned into a sham—
cursed and empty.
Laughter died off, as did family nights. The three of us walked around like
zombies, but none of us talked about it. I became dead on the inside,
detached from life. Ajax pulled away from the rest of us, filling his time
with work. Mia bottled everything up on the inside.
With Ajax’s new influx of income, Dad didn’t have to remain in the
Cayman Islands, nor did he have to work long hours, so our parents
returned home.
Ajax purchased a condo in Soho and moved out. However, he barely visited
New York with his rigorous travel schedule. He flew from city to city,
promoting his app to various financial institutions. He lived on the road and
seemed to prefer it that way.
The moment I graduated from high school, I moved out as well. I couldn’t
live in that suffocating house any longer. We all moved away from each
other, reuniting on holidays and select weekends. Other than Mia, I barely
saw my family, and the same held true of Ajax.
“Where are Sam, John, and Ulysses?” Raven asked. “I thought they were
flying in with you, Janeen and Mary. Shouldn’t everyone be here by now?”
“Hah,” I scoffed. “Remember the movie Parent Trap? Seems that’s what
they set up for us. Janeen booked me an earlier flight. I think they want us
to sort our shit.”
Raven didn’t react, smiling politely.
“So, should we?” I finally broke the silence, unable to take the
awkwardness.
“Should we what?”
“Sort our shit.”
What the fuck was I saying? It was as if the moment I saw her, none of the
awful shit mattered. How did she always have this effect on me?
Raven appeared just as surprised by my suggestion. “I don’t think that’s up
to me,” she said flatly.
Irritation pulsed through me. I felt powerless and back to square one. I
wanted her to grovel and say that she missed me. I spent my life longing for
her; for once, I needed her to feed my ego.
“How’s that?” I asked.
She tried to smile. “I believe it was your decision to end our friendship. I
never stopped being your friend. You just chose not to be mine.”
If only she understood; I had been hers since we were born. “You didn’t
exactly call to make up.”
“I did, but I took the hint when you blocked me,” Raven pointed out.
A momentary guilt fleeted over me. I had blocked her from every medium,
not wanting to initiate contact during a moment of weakness. That was why
I barely saw my family.
“It’s okay,” Raven whispered when I didn’t respond. “You did warn me not
to contact you.”
“You dropped a bomb on me. I was upset.” I reminded myself she was
lethal. She couldn’t be my lover, but she couldn’t be my friend, either. She
treated me like dirt.
“I know,” she admitted quietly. “I’m sorry. You have no idea how sorry I
am. I have been miserable for the last couple of years, thinking over and
over about how I could have done things differently. I—I needed to get
away from... New York, but I fucked up. I was caught up in my emotions
and forgot we were a package deal. You would have never done that to me.
I was selfish.” Raven lowered her eyes.
“Yeah, well. I guess there is no point in rehashing the past. We are both here
for the weekend with our friends. Let’s be adults about it and get along.”
Raven’s smile lit up the room. “I think that’s an excellent idea, and thank
you for putting this weekend together.”
“I didn’t put this weekend together.”
Raven frowned. “I asked Janeen how much I should pitch in for the Airbnb.
Mom would have been happy to pay, but Janeen said you took care of all
the bills and activities.”
“I only financed it. Janeen planned everything.”
“Oh. Well, thank you for financing it.”
“You can thank Ajax. It was his money.”
We both froze at the mention of his name. I hadn’t meant to bring Ajax up.
Whatever happened between them must have been bad for Raven to leave
the way she did. As much as I loathed her, I could recognize the facts.
“Umm... okay. I’d prefer to pay for my half of the Airbnb.”
“That won’t work.”
“I insist. I can take your money, but I can’t take Ajax’s. Don’t ask me why.”
I shook my head. “Ajax gave the money to me as a gift. It’s my money now,
and I can choose to do with it as I please.”
I could see Raven’s hesitation. She was uncomfortable with this. Very
uncomfortable. Why? Ajax used to pay for us all the time. It was never a
problem before.
“What exactly happened between you and Ajax?” I asked hesitantly.
“Nothing.” Raven stared at me blankly. “Hey, so I feel gross after the flight.
I’ll take a quick shower and change. Why don’t we grab dinner and catch
up afterward?”
I gave her a curt nod. Raven toured the house to decide which bedroom she
wanted and disappeared inside one to shower. In turn, I scrounged for
alcohol from the fully stocked fridge. This was going to be a long weekend.
The weekend flew by. I thought it was going to be excruciating. A disaster.
In reality, it wasn't half bad.
It was challenging to get a rise out of Raven. Derailing her had no effect
because she didn’t react. Nor did she hold grudges about how I had spoken
to her the last time we saw each other. So it was easy to act civil.
The first night we arrived in Costa Rica, we went to dinner. Our friends
came later that night, giving us time to make amends. We spoke for hours. I
wouldn’t say we made up, but we got along.
I’d still never see her as the girl I once loved. However, after years of
feeling dead inside, I finally felt emotions again, which was exhilarating. I
could tell the same held true for Raven. When I first saw her at the
doorway, there was a spark missing. Throughout the weekend, the color on
her cheeks returned, and she was lively again.
I learned a lot about her new life. She was attending IFA in Paris for her
undergraduate degree. It was a three-year program, and after that, she was
to work with her mom as a designer.
As for me, I decided to attend New York University. My undergraduate was
a four-year program, so she’d graduate before me.
We never discussed Ajax again throughout the weekend.
The weekend was filled with debauchery after our friends arrived. I tried to
stay away from Raven, but a traitor inside my chest sought her out. It was
the old Reid and Raven, especially when we performed a soliloquy of
musical numbers after everyone else went to sleep.
No tune.
No musical talent.
All the wrong lyrics.
Nonetheless, we got drunk and sang our hearts out.
In a way, so much had changed between us, yet nothing had changed.
For the first time in so long, I was human again. When you were so numb,
you simply existed in life. Feeling anything was better than nothing at all.
Even if that emotion sliced your heart open, watching it bleed to death
because that was how it felt when we parted ways at the airport. My heart
sliced open as I watched her board the plane, but I couldn’t chase after her
again. Not after everything.
3 MONTHS AGO - DECEMBER 2019.
Reid.
After the Costa Rica trip, Raven and I kept in touch here and
there. The texts were polite at the beginning, periodically checking in.
Within the month, the texts had developed into routine messages, and by the
start of summer, we were hopping on daily phone and video calls.
Midway through summer, Raven invited me to visit her in Paris, and I
agreed.
One might suggest none of this was a good idea, but feeling emotions
became the highlight of my life, and I only felt emotions around one person
in this world. I’d never fall in love with her again, but I couldn’t live life
denying what we meant to one another. She’d always be my best friend and
my other half. I couldn’t change that. Our codependency on each other was
unconventional, but it was also the only thing that made me complete. So, I
negotiated with myself.
I’d allow myself small glimpses of her, and it’d be enough to make me feel
but not enough to destroy me.
Despite what I told myself, I counted the days until my flight to Paris.
Initially, anxiety seeped through me at the idea. The last time I spent a
summer in Paris with her, she sprung a boyfriend on me, along with leaving
my ass over a text message.
However, things were different this time.
I had heard through the grapevines that Raven had become popular with
Parisian men. The information created an odd sensation in my stomach that
I chose to ignore.
After reuniting, the tune of the gossip changed. She was no longer
entertaining men.
Though I wasn’t sure, I believed Raven had figured out I used to be in love
with her. Both in Costa Rica and Paris, she was diligent about never
entertaining men. If anyone hit on her, she’d scoot away to stand behind
me. Raven had always been unaware of male attention, but suddenly, she
was on a mission to not flaunt anything in my face. Little did she know how
much I had moved on.
Nonetheless, I never corrected her assumptions. It was best if she thought I
had feelings for her and continued never to date anyone again. I didn’t want
her, but I didn’t want anyone else to have her, either. I spent the first
seventeen years of my life putting her happiness first. It was her turn to do
the same. She owed me after the shit she put me through. She could die a
spinster, and that was fine by me.
It wasn’t like I was jealous or anything. She was nothing more to me than a
friend. A very beautiful friend. A friend who seemed to define my very
existence. A friend who I’d never want to share with another man.
Regardless, she was just a friend.
That’s why I couldn’t understand why my heart sliced open again after the
summer in Paris ended and I returned to New York. Over the following
semester, I itched to return to Paris. The cycle repeated itself during every
break.
At the beginning of the year, we decided on another joint party in Paris to
celebrate our twenty-first birthday. Mia and my parents flew in for the
festivities. We celebrated the milestone as we had always planned.
Since my return from Paris, I have returned to my hollow shell once more. I
waited impatiently for the next trip—a New Year’s Eve trip to Barcelona.
Every day closer to the trip was a struggle as the clock slowed, and I willed
the ticking hands to move faster. On the day of the trip, I arrived at the
airport four hours early, leaving no room for error. You’d think I’d be
exhausted after an overnight flight, but by the time I landed in Barcelona, it
was like someone had dumped cold water on me. I was alert, cognizant, and
breathing for the first time in weeks.
Our friends decided to celebrate New Year’s Eve in Barcelona at an annual
fancy party called Pueblo Espanyol. It was held in a castle, so our friends
were excited.
However, I was only excited for one reason. Today was the day I saw Raven
again. Today was the day I got to feel again. Like a kid on Christmas, I had
been jittery for days. My flight landed an hour ago, and I waited anxiously
at the airport for Raven’s arrival so we could take a taxi together.
“Hey, Stud.”
I turned to find a mass of black hair running toward me. “Hi, Beautiful.” I
had barely gotten the words out when two arms wrapped around my neck.
My heart stopped, then it started beating so hard I thought it might break
out of my chest.
“How was your flight?” Raven broke contact to inquire.
“Long. Want to get out of here?”
“Yup, let’s go.”
Exiting the airport, we hailed a taxi to the Airbnb. None of our other friends
were here yet, so we were in charge of meeting with the owners and checkin. Thankfully, the house came fully stocked with liquor and food.
After the owners left, Raven made a beeline for upstairs to change. She
preferred to wear shorts and tank tops whenever we settled into a place. The
only exception to this rule was around Theressa. Raven put on makeup and
nice clothes around her mom. It was easier to give in to Theressa than deal
with the nagging. Theressa could nag for hours, while a change of clothing
and makeup application took thirty minutes.
Theressa’s crazy had reached a new level. She sent an unacceptable email to
Raven. I heard about this email before but had only recently read it. Raven
must have been devastated, though she never brought it up. I awaited
Raven’s return to discuss the email, chugging one of the beers from the
fridge.
Where is she?
Raven’s absence made the house too quiet for comfort, and I impatiently
tapped my foot against the bar stool. Finally, I heard footsteps descending
the stairs.
“Already drinking?” She nodded at my beer.
“The better question is, why aren’t you? We are on vacation.”
“Good point. Make me something.”
I grabbed the cocktail shaker to make a mixed drink. “So, were you going
to tell me about the email from Theressa? Why did I have to hear about it
through Janeen?”
“What is there to talk about?” Raven muttered quietly.
“Come on, Rave. You might as well tell me what happened and save me the
hassle of digging it out of you.”
“Okay,” Raven began slowly. “After my parents got back together, I
discovered they were never officially divorced, only separated. Dad never
wanted a divorce, and Mom never pushed for it. Come to find out, it was
because Mom wanted to take Dad back, but she held off because of me.”
Recently, Uncle John won Theressa back. The news shocked everyone as
Theressa’s interest in reuniting with Uncle John was unprecedented. When
she was offered the job in Europe, Theressa left both her husband and child
behind. In an email to Raven, Theressa admitted Raven was an accident as
she never wanted the responsibilities of being a mother and would’ve taken
Uncle John to Europe if they didn't have Raven. A child was too much
responsibility with to her job restraints.
Janeen had discovered the year-and-a-half-old email mentioning these nittygritty particulars. If I knew Raven at all, this wasn’t something she could
easily recover from, especially without the Sinclair clan's support. I didn’t
pay close enough attention when I first saw her in Costa Rica, but it later
sunk in that Raven had dark circles around her eyes. She looked anorexic
and didn’t make as many jokes.
Over time, Raven reverted to her old self. Her humor had returned, the dark
circles were gone, and she had regained her curves. Every time I returned to
Paris, Raven was vibrant and full of life. As was I. We were our best
versions around each other. That was why it was irritating our parents were
the ones to take us down.
When Raven didn’t respond, I raised an eyebrow. “Why the hell would she
send that email unprovoked?” I asked with frustration.
“It wasn’t unprovoked; I confronted them. Why didn’t they get back
together when I was younger if they were never divorced, and why are they
back together now, after I was grown? I bugged them continuously about it.
One day, Theressa snapped and emailed me a response.”
“She is an asshole. No offense.”
“None taken.” Raven shrugged.
Raven and I spoke freely. She was the only person allowed to trash Tessa if
it seemed fit and vice versa. However, if anyone other than Raven insulted
my mother, I’d break their nose.
“Theressa is also full of shit. She could have taken Uncle John back at any
point.”
“Except she couldn't,” Raven countered. “Not without explaining why the
family was reuniting while I was left behind in New York. That would have
further destroyed her image in front of everyone we knew.”
Wow. I shook my head, downing my beer. Theressa really was a fucking
bitch. “Rave, why were you still working for Theressa? I get that they are
your parents but come on.”
“It’s not them.”
Umm, I had to disagree. “Yes, it is Rave.”
“It’s not,” Raven whispered. “Theressa wanted to live a glamorous life with
John by her side. They had to separate because I was too much
responsibility. They decided to get back together after I was no longer a
factor. I was the one driving a wedge in their marriage. How can I be mad at
them?”
Stumped by Raven’s words, I openly gaped at her. I was angry upon hearing
about Theressa’s email. My anger only fumed at the thought of Raven
continuing to surround herself with people like her parents. However, my
concerns should have waited because Raven’s heart was breaking at the
reminder.
Fuck.
I moved from behind the counter to gather her in my arms when Raven
stood abruptly. “You were right, Reid.”
“Right about what?”
“I am toxic,” she whispered.
“Rave, no,” I said incredulously, but Raven didn’t wait for me to continue.
She spun on her heels and marched up the stairs.
I was left rooted and staring at the stairs, incapable of movement.
I wanted to throw things at the wall. I wanted to scream at the top of my
lungs. I wanted to call Theressa and Uncle John to threaten murder for
making Raven feel this shitty and unwanted. Most of all, I wanted to punch
my seventeen-year-old self for saying those awful things to her.
My heart was breaking into so many pieces because her heart was breaking.
That’s what happened when you shared one heart, and that’s when the truth
slapped me in the face.
The epic conclusion of my feelings stabbed me in the chest as realization
coursed through my veins. The one I had locked away in a coffin.
Something I had already admitted to myself deep down but couldn’t
acknowledge out loud.
I was still madly in love with that emotionally damaged, frustratingly
proud, overly analytical, crazy female. She was fucking crazy. She truly
was, and I still fucking loved her.
Please, God, when will you stop making me love this crazy woman?
The first question to pop into my head was—Could Raven feel the same for
me? If Raven did want me, how would I pursue a woman who lived
thousands of miles away? Could I get over what happened with Ajax, or
would it always factor into an underlying resentment between us? Could I
forgive her enough to become the man she needed?
I didn’t know the answers to any of these questions. All I knew was I loved
her. I was so in love with her that every pain she felt, I felt it tenfold more. I
was so in love that my next breath was impossible without her.
I couldn’t think straight. My body was immobile, though it didn’t matter. I
willed myself to move because nothing would stop me from being by her
side.
Taking the stairs two at a time, I rushed upstairs. I searched room after room
and found her crouched on the floor, unpacking her luggage in the bedroom
she had selected.
“You are not toxic,” I said from the door frame.
“Oh, hey, Stud,” Raven looked up.
“You are not toxic,” I repeated.
“I am,” Raven whispered. “It’s obvious.”
“No. You are not,” I reiterated. “I was seventeen and a dumb kid who
expected you to make your life decisions based on me. It was unfair. I said
horrible things to you out of anger. The truth is you are the only one who
made our family whole.”
“No, I was so selfish. I betrayed your trust. You don’t know what I did
before I left—”
“I know about you and Ajax,” I blurted. I didn’t mean to, but I couldn’t
listen to her admissions. I didn’t want to hear her talk about Ajax. Couldn’t
bear to hear his name on her lips. I communicated as much with Raven
telepathically. “Yet, I don’t think you are toxic,” I finished.
Raven was tense, muscles rigid. The tension in the room was palpable. “I
am sorry,” she finally spoke.
“It was a long time ago. It doesn’t matter anymore.”
We stared at each other uncomfortably. Finally, I spearheaded the
conversation. There was only one thing about her and Ajax I wondered
about throughout the years. “Why him?” I asked her directly. “He was the
one person I told you not to pursue. Why did you pursue him, of all
people?” My anger rose at just the little inquiry.
Raven opened her mouth before closing it promptly, contemplating. “I was
seventeen and a dumb kid,” she finally responded.
“You can’t use my words against me, Rave.”
“It’s the truth. I was young. I didn’t know better. I got attention from an
older man, and I took it.”
“Raven, do you expect me to believe that? You were the mature one in our
group.”
Raven blasted to her feet. “See, that’s the problem. People assumed I was so
mature when I was just a dumb high school kid. I had always been slow to
react and needed time to analyze things at my speed. That’s why I don’t
lash out. People perceive it as me being wise beyond my age. I am not. I’m
indecisive and overly analytical. It’s not the best thing to hear, but those are
my flaws. Every human being is allowed to have them. The truth is I was a
dumb kid who had no business making life-altering decisions. Yet I did.”
Raven stopped her rant. A sudden flicker of realization or some sort of
acceptance crossed her face.
“We both did,” Raven muttered under her breath. “Ajax was young. He
made a mistake as well.” Raven stared at her hands. A few moments passed
before she spoke again. “Ajax might have acted like a responsible adult, but
he was the same age as we are. Look at us. All we do is party and travel. He
never experienced it because he took care of us. He was stunted in his way.
Ajax assumed I was this mature woman who could help him when I simply
didn’t know better. He made a horrible mistake with me.” Raven’s voice
trembled, eyes tearing up. Her breathing hitched as she shuddered. “I was
just—”
“—an escape from his shitty life,” I finished for Raven, unable to watch her
do this to herself.
“I regret it.” She took a sharp inhale. “I think we both do,” Raven added
slowly. “I’m sure he has grown up a lot since we last saw each other, and I
hope he turned into the man he was always meant to be.”
I could tell Raven was skimming over crucial details. However, I didn’t
want to hear more of this. The Band-Aid had needed to be ripped off. I had
confronted her and would rather we never spoke of it again. The thought of
her and Ajax made me want to crawl out of my skin.
“Can you forgive me?” Raven asked.
“I have known for years. We are still standing, aren’t we?”
Raven jumped into my arms. We didn’t need more words; we only needed
each other. I held her so tight I was probably squeezing the life out of her.
“Reid,” Raven snapped me out of my lull.
“Hmm?”
“I’m not working for Mom anymore.”
“You are not?”
“No, but things are now okay with my parents. They both feel guilty about
the email.”
“Good, they should.”
Raven laughed. “Things have been civil, but Mom’s business is suffering.
We discussed it, and I decided to pursue my career separate from hers. I got
an internship with Karen. It’s unpaid but working for her will be good for
my resume. I’m moving back to New York.”
Hope. All the hope I had buried reignited like flames in a forest fire.
Despite telling myself to pump the brakes, hope spread through me. I had to
slow down. I only realized half an hour ago I still loved her. We just
discussed the biggest hurdle in our lives. I shouldn’t get ahead of myself,
yet I couldn’t stop.
Raven would be in the same city as me. Proximity meant possibility. In the
back of my mind, one of my doubts was immediately appeased. If we were
in the same city, there was a possibility.
Could she possibly want more with me? There was another hindrance still
at large. If she wanted more, could I get over what happened between
Raven and Ajax to be the man she deserved, or would I resent her?
Until I knew for sure I couldn’t choose anything different for us because I
couldn’t deal with it if I hurt her. So, I said nothing more and kissed the top
of Raven’s head, keeping her locked in my arms.
A FEW DAYS AGO - MARCH 8TH, 2020.
Reid.
“What are you going to do?” I asked while refraining from rolling
my eyes.
“I’ll figure it out. I always do,” Raven said with a wave of her hand, casting
me her usual nonchalant glance.
“This is ridiculous.”
We were at Raven’s place. It was in a shitty neighborhood, and she shared
the apartment with two weirdos. I hated that she lived here, though my
dorm was only a few blocks away.
Though my irritation rose, I decided a positive attitude was more productive
in this situation. My optimism quickly dissipated as I glanced around.
Raven sorted through the mail on the table. One of the dining table chairs
was broken. The smoke alarm was hanging off the ceiling. The paint on the
wall was chipped. There was an open electric line.
I couldn’t help the pang of pain over her residing in this disgusting hole she
called home. No matter how often I asked her, she refused to move back
into our family house.
So, I’d had no choice but to suck it up. Raven was stubborn as a mule. She
refused my offers to help and wouldn’t take my money because Ajax was
my source of income. She threatened not to talk to me when I bought her
groceries.
However, I couldn’t hold back anymore. One way or another, she was going
to move home. “Rave, I am moving home, too. Move back with me. I don’t
understand the problem.”
Raven smiled again. “Reid, there is no problem. I am fine.”
“You lost your job.”
“I have savings.”
“We both know that’s a lie. What’s the big deal with moving home,
anyways?”
“This is my home.”
“This isn’t your home. Plus, you don’t have a source of income and won’t
be able to pay rent. What logical reason could you possibly have to keep
living here?”
Raven turned quiet.
I continued my rant, hell-bent on making her see reason. “You have no
financial support, and you have debt up to your neck. You can barely make
rent and groceries as it is. What do you plan to do without a job? You won’t
take money from me because it’s Ajax’s money. Unlike Ajax, I won’t come
into my trust fund till we are twenty-two which is two months away. I can
pay off your debt then, but what do you plan to do in the meanwhile? You
are a rational person, Rave. Give me a rational answer.” It was harsh, but
how else would I get through to her? Why was she so unreasonable?
It hit me, then. Ajax. He was the reason she didn’t want to move home.
Raven never went into details about her relationship with Ajax. As far as I
was concerned, they had a one-night stand. The visual shut down
everything inside me for years. I refused the possibility they might have
shared more than one night.
“Is it because of Ajax?” I asked suspiciously.
“What?” Raven tensed.
My suspicions were confirmed. Why did she still care so much? He didn’t.
Following the irritation came the anger I used to feel as a fifteen-year-old
boy. Raging hormones. Out of control. Out of my mind.
“Ajax,” I repeated angrily. “Is this because of him?”
“Trust me when I tell you it’s not a good idea for me to move back.”
“Why don’t you want to be around him?” I pressed.
“He is still angry with me for leaving,” Raven said faintly. “I’m not ready to
face him. You know me, I hate confrontations.”
I didn’t want Raven around Ajax, either. As much as I hated the idea of
them in close quarters, Raven’s well-being took precedence. Plus, seeing
them together might determine if I could deal with their past. I could finally
move on with my life if I saw something unsavory. I shook my head. Who
was I kidding? There was no moving on from her; there never had been.
“Rave, you live in New York and are bound to see Ajax sooner or later. You
might as well bury the hatchet. He is always working, anyways, so I doubt
you’ll see much of him. Plus, everyone else is also moving home. How
awkward can it be with everyone around?”
Raven stared at me, the logical words getting through to her.
“If it makes you feel better,” I continued, “I’ll stick by you every second of
the day and act as your buffer.”
“Even when I sleep?”
I laughed. “I’ll move into your damn room if you want. I have no
commitments, so you’ll never be alone and can avoid the awkward
conversation with Ajax for as long as you want.”
Raven took a deep breath and nodded firmly. “Okay. I’ll move home.”
I kissed her on the cheek. “You are making the right decision.”
MARCH 11TH, 2020.
Reid.
Moving my things and Raven’s stuff into the house took a few
days. We were finally settled in, but something was off. Raven seemed
down. Her spirit was heavy, and her smiles were few and far between.
Last night, I thought she was having a mental breakdown. We went to her
room, and she kept staring at a spot on the carpet. Later I caught her
scrubbing the carpet with a paper towel and bleach. Something was off.
I decided to go for a run to clear my head. Upon returning home, I took my
shirt off and threw it in the hamper when I noticed a few texts from Raven.
I peeked inside her room, calling out her name when I heard the shower
running and noticed the bathroom door was wide open.
Odd.
Other than our parents, none of us knocked when we entered each other’s
rooms. So, if you were indecent, you locked the door. If you were in the
bathroom, you shut the door. Something told me Raven wasn’t showering.
I poked my head inside to find Raven standing under the showerhead. She
was fully clothed in her black tank top and a pair of sleeping shorts. Raven
stared blankly at the wall as the water rained on her. My heart squeezed in
my chest. I walked closer to open the shower door, but she didn’t notice my
presence.
“Rave? What’s going on?”
Raven snapped out of her glazed look and turned her head to the side. “Oh.
Hey, Stud.”
“What’s wrong?” I asked more gently.
“Nothing. Can you give me a few minutes?”
“No.”
“What?”
“I said no. I am going to stand here with you.”
“If you are going to stand there, at least close the door. You are letting the
steam out.”
I stepped inside the shower in my gym shorts and stood behind her. The
shower was large enough to maintain a safe distance from the water.
Who the hell stood under a shower while fully clothed? I told you this
woman was utterly insane.
“Okay, stupid. I meant, stand on the other side of the closed door,” Raven
laughed.
“I’ve made my decision. I am standing here in case you change your mind
about talking.”
Raven appeared surprised but didn’t argue. I stood behind her, observing
quietly. There was more to the story of Raven’s history with this house.
“You never explained why you left New York so suddenly,” I said suddenly.
Raven said nothing.
“Why did you leave New York so suddenly?” I asked more forcefully this
time.
“I-I… a few things happened that were hard for me to deal with at the time.
I hurt you. I slept with Ajax. If I had stayed, it would have happened again.
So, I left.”
“That doesn’t make sense.” I frowned at the information. “You could have
told Ajax it was a mistake and moved forward. You didn’t have to move to
Paris. All you had to do was end it if you thought you were betraying me.”
“Why are you so convinced I didn’t try to end things?” Raven muttered.
“Did you?”
“Yes.”
“If you ended things with him, why were you worried it would happen
again if you stayed here?” I asked in an irritated voice, anger getting the
best of me. It resonated with every word, the tension in the shower
palpable.
Moving to Paris was drastic. She didn’t have to leave me. All she had to do
was tell Ajax they had made a mistake. We could have moved on with our
lives. She should have stayed in New York as we had always planned.
In typical Raven fashion, she didn’t want to deal with the awkwardness.
Well, tough. She had made her bed, then had sex on it with my brother, so
she should have laid on it.
“It’s in the past, Reid. It’s not worth discussing,” Raven said tightly. “Ajax
did a lot for me. I won’t tarnish his name in front of his younger brother.
Can we just move on?”
“Tarnish his name? What did he do to tarnish his name?”
Raven tensed as if she hadn’t meant to let the words slip. There was an odd
sinking feeling in my stomach. Was there more to the story?
She refused to divulge what made her leave New York. Not to mention,
when I first saw Raven again, she looked ghostly. What could have
happened that was so bad?
“Did he do something?” I asked more gently.
“W-what?” Raven stammered.
“Did Ajax do something to you?”
My stomach flipped as the atrocious thought took root. It didn’t make sense.
Ajax would never hurt Raven, though a gut feeling spiraled saying
otherwise.
“Did he hurt you?” I whispered.
Raven continued with the silence. I wished she’d tell me because my mind
was conjuring the worst. Was there another woman? Did Ajax hit her? Did
he do something sexually?
“Did he hurt you?” I roared so loud that Raven jumped. My body was
shaking, feeling like the ground below was about to cave. What did he do
that was so bad?
Raven twisted her torso. “Reid, stop. Ajax didn’t hurt me,” she said quickly.
Why didn’t I believe her? “Then what aren’t you telling me?”
“Nothing,” she muttered.
I didn’t believe her. There was something off about this situation. “If he hurt
a hair on your head—”
“Reid, stop,” Raven said more forcefully this time. “You are ridiculous. Of
course, Ajax didn’t hurt me. How could you think that?”
Lies. She was telling me all lies, but what was she lying about?
Fine. If Raven didn’t want to discuss Ajax, there was something on my
mind. I had already suspected her inkling about my feelings. This Ajax
topic was spurring emotions of my own. I might as well put it all out on the
table. It was time.
Neither of us had directly addressed the issue. Twenty-one years, and we
had never once discussed the elephant in the room.
“When you and Ajax hooked up, did you know how I felt about you?” I let
the words sink in. My heart was beating in anticipation of Raven’s answer.
Raven’s silence confirmed my suspicions. Although I had assumed she
knew, I couldn’t help the irrational anger coursing me.
“You knew!” I growled, grabbing her by the back of her shoulders.
Raven jumped from the volume of my voice echoing through the bathroom.
“You knew how I felt about you, but you did it anyway. You fucked my
brother, Rave. How could you do that to me?” I panted, shaking her
ferociously.
“I didn’t know,” Raven whispered. “Not at the time. Once I found out, I
didn’t want to keep hurting you. It was one of the reasons why I left. I made
a mistake with Ajax. I tried my best to fix it, but it made you hate me
instead.”
“That doesn't make sense,” I yelled. Our voices echoed in the enclosed
shower as our words bounced between the walls. “What do you mean you’d
keep betraying me if you stayed? All you had to do was not have sex with
him again. Why couldn’t you do that? How hard is it to keep your knees
together? Or were you so enthralled like every other woman by the great
Ajax Sinclair that you couldn’t be near him without having to fuck him?
Tell me.”
“I made a mistake,” Raven said quietly. “I told you that. After it was over, I
had to get away from here. That’s all there is to it.”
We were going around in circles. Raven wasn’t giving me a straight answer
about why she left, and my anger wasn’t dying out. She still pursued Ajax
after I told her not to. The betrayal alone was a tough pill to swallow, but
the hardest pill was the possibility of her never feeling the same for me.
“When I was younger, I always thought we would somehow end up
together,” I said in a low voice. “I thought you would snap out of your
cynicism. I thought you’d get over whatever fascination you had with older
men. I thought you’d finally see me.” I shook my head. “What is so hateful
and unlovable about me you couldn't possibly see me in that light?”
Raven gave out a husky laugh.
Anger rinsed through me. I was pouring my heart out, and she was laughing
in my face. My fingers flexed in her shoulders, tightening the grip.
“When I was younger, I always thought we’d somehow end up together,”
she muttered.
Raven repeated my words, but her following sentence filled my hollow
words with the meaningfulness I sought.
“Everyone always told us as much, so an optimistic side of me thought
that’s where life would lead us. This was before my cynicism for love. This
was before my parents’ separation. This was before I saw Tessa and Uncle
Reese. This was before we became part of the same family. I didn’t see you
that way after growing up, but when I was little, I spent hours writing Mrs.
Reid Sinclair in my notebook. So, there is nothing hateful or unlovable
about you. You’re the best man in the world and can make any girl fall in
love with you. The problem lies only with the person I have become.”
I couldn’t move. All these years, the misunderstandings, my failed attempts
to tell her about my feelings, while she had felt the same way I did when we
were younger. If she felt it once, could she feel it again?
Right then and there, I received the answer to my last question. Could I get
past Raven sleeping with Ajax?
I could because none of the rest mattered the moment she said those words.
I wasn’t concerned with right or wrong. I didn’t care if she slept with my
brother. She was the only thing I had ever wanted, and I couldn’t live
without her.
I moved without direction or a plan, pushing Raven’s long dark hair off to
one side and placing a small kiss on her neck. I stopped for a heart-
pounding second, breathing in her scent. The small act had me wound tight,
paralyzed.
Raven tensed. Without giving her a chance to react, I spun her in place. I
grabbed her waist, pinning her against the shower wall. Before Raven could
speak, my lips came colliding against hers. One of my hands went to her
hair while the other cupped her face. I kissed her aggressively to show her
what I was pouring into it. Years of yearning, longing, and pining came out
with one kiss. I kissed Raven like it was the last time I’d kiss anyone. I
pushed my tongue inside her mouth and explored her. Her soft lips, her
moist mouth; it was electrifying. Dynamic.
The hot water had run out, and we were being doused by cold water. The
cold water didn’t affect how hard I was for her. My breathing shuddered,
heart racing. My ears pounded as I kissed her desperately. This was
everything, what I had wanted all my life, and I was never willing to let go.
Except, Raven was willing to let go. She gently pushed me back—eyes
lowered—without offering an explanation.
“Why?” I asked. Why was she stopping this? This was what we had both
wanted since we were babies.
“You know why.”
“Because of Ajax?”
“I have made some bad decisions in my life, Reid, and I am working on
cleaning up my mess. I have to make better decisions moving forward. This
is not it.”
“Raven—”
“Please, Reid. I am begging you. Don’t make me into this person. Don’t
make me the person who can’t face myself because I’m disgusted by my
behavior. I love you with all my heart. I’ll give you my kidney. Hell, I’ll
give you every single one of my organs if you need it. I’ll die for you, but I
can’t do this for you.”
My head rested on her neck. I had never wanted anything so much in my
life. I wanted this more than my next breath. However, Raven wanted to
stop because she slept with Ajax. She couldn’t deal with herself if she felt
cheap, and if I pushed her, that’s how I’d make her feel.
I couldn’t do that to Raven. That’s not love.
I took a step back and let her go. Turning around, I exited the shower as
Raven turned off the water. Closing the bathroom door behind me, I
returned to my room.
MARCH 12TH, 2020.
Reid.
I didn't sleep last night.
I stayed up all night thinking about our kiss. It was a kiss twenty-two years
in the making and didn’t disappoint.
We wouldn’t be here if I had told her about my feelings years ago. I should
have told her when we were twelve instead of waiting a decade. There
would have been no one else for us, and we could have been pure and
preserved, the way our love was meant to be.
Some of it might be tainted now. Nonetheless, it was still pure because what
I felt for her was the purest form of love anyone had experienced.
Raven told me she also thought we might end up together. After growing
up, she lost faith in love. Maybe I needed to reinstall faith in her again. She
needed to open her eyes and give us a chance. I couldn’t return to how
things were, not after that kiss.
I had been moving the remaining things from my dorm today, and Raven
was at work. So, we hadn’t had any interaction. The last day of her
internship was tomorrow before the office closed. I was busy tomorrow as
well, tying up loose ends on campus.
So, I had to address it with her tonight. It was ten p.m., but Raven was still
up.
“Hey, Beautiful.” I poked my head in.
Raven smiled nervously. “Hey, Stud. How was the move?”
“It was exhausting. I have to return tomorrow and have a few more things
to take care of. I’ll be gone all day again, so I wanted to check in with you.”
I stepped into the room. Raven was on the bed with her laptop out. Her
floor was covered in boxes and clothes, looking like Tessa’s room from
back in the day. It was a mess.
“Did you have a good day?” I moved a couple of things to join her on the
bed.
“Mostly. I have been unpacking and changing up the room.”
“I think everyone is going to officially move in tomorrow.”
“Oh.”
I eyed her tentatively. She didn’t sound thrilled by the news. She didn’t
want to see Ajax, and I didn’t want to be another person with a strained
relationship with Raven. We had to sort this out.
Raven beat me to it. “Reid, we need to talk.”
I nodded in agreement. “Yes, we do.”
“Reid,” she stated. “I can’t lose you. You are my best—”
“I love you,” I blurted before I could stop myself. I couldn’t listen to her
about how I was her best friend. Or her brother from another mother. I
loved her. She had already guessed it, so I needed to man up and say it at
least once. I owed it to myself.
“And I love you,” Raven replied.
“That’s not how I meant it. At least have enough respect not to condescend
me.”
This conversation was quickly turning sour. That’s the thing with rejection;
it could flip things and haunt you. I had endured years of rejection, first
from my mother, then from Raven. It was all returning in a flash and boiling
down to this moment.
Somewhere deep down, I had hoped for a different response from Raven.
“I’m sorry,” Raven conceded. “You’re right. When we were little, our
families joked we’d end up together. It was ingrained into both of us. Deep
inside my optimistic mind, I thought it could be a possibility. As I grew up,
I only saw the ugly sides of love. I lost faith, and the faith has never been
restored. So, I shelved the idea away.”
Raven stood to pace. So, I stood as well and dogged her steps.
“After we grew up, I saw you as my family member,” Raven continued.
“As far as I am concerned, you and Mia are my only family. I can’t give
you more than that. The side effects of romantic love have always been my
destruction. Every bad thing that happened in my life stemmed from
romantic love. Can you at least understand that?”
“Just because it happened to other people doesn’t mean it’ll happen to us.
We are different. We are best friends—”
“I also thought Ajax was my best friend,” Raven muttered, looking at the
same spot on the carpet she was cleaning the other day. Did she spill
something? She didn’t have OCD tendencies about cleaning. I could hardly
focus on it, though, too hyped by my emotions.
“So, this is about Ajax?”
“Yes,” Raven sighed. “I can’t fathom being the slut passed between the
Sinclair brothers.”
“I don’t see it that way.”
“Yet, that’s how it is.”
“Rave, please—”
“There are other things that scare the shit out of me. Ajax used to be one of
my best friends, but our friendship changed, and within a short time, it
destroyed everything. My relationship with you. My friendship with Ajax.
My family. It cost me everything I cared about, and I walked around like a
corpse for years. That’s the after-effect of romance. It destroys and burns
until there is nothing left. I am sorry, Reid. I can’t risk it; I can’t risk losing
you.”
I understood where she was coming from. I truly did. Raven didn’t want to
feel cheap, and if anyone had bad experiences with love, it was Raven.
However, I couldn’t do this anymore, either. There was no going back for
me. I wasn’t angry at her, only sad. I couldn’t be around her and feel this
way. It was torture.
“Raven, I am sorry. I can’t do this,” I said quietly. “I can’t be just your
friend anymore. It’s too hard.”
Raven stopped short and stared at me with wide eyes screaming with shock.
I turned to leave, but Raven lunged at my back and covered me with a hug.
“Please, please, Reid. Don’t do this again. I am checking my pride at the
door. I’ll beg if you want. Please don’t leave me again. I can’t live without
you.”
I spoke without turning to face her. “If you can’t live without me, why can’t
you be with me?”
“Reid, I already told you—”
This time I did turn and grabbed Raven by the arms. “You told me you
don’t want to be passed between the Sinclair brothers, but no one knows
about you guys, and we can tell Ajax not to say anything, either. It was
years ago, and Ajax has more than moved on. It could be as if it never
happened. I’m the only one with a right to be pissed, and I don’t care. I
don’t care about anything that keeps you from me. So, what the hell is the
problem?” I growled.
Raven opened her mouth, but I cut her off. I wasn’t done with my tirade.
“You once told me true love was the familial and friendship type of love.
Guess what? I am your best fucking friend. I’m your true family. By your
definition, I am the only true love you’ll know.”
“Reid, I—”
“No, Raven! No more excuses. I love you. I have loved you since we were
born. Enough already. I’m not asking you to say it back; I am only asking
for a chance. Just try. If I am truly your soulmate, why can’t you at least
try?”
“It’s complicated, Reid.”
“Then I can’t be around you. I can’t watch you with someone else. It’ll kill
me.”
“There is no one else,” Raven shrieked. “If you haven’t noticed, there hasn’t
been anyone in the last two years. I don’t care to be with anyone. I just can’t
lose you or Mia.”
Raven’s plea might stir my heart, but I was a determined man. I had one
mission. Nothing else mattered.
“If I can come back from the fact you slept with my brother, I can never
move on from you,” I admitted in a whisper.
I pulled Raven into my arms. Raven seemed reluctant but stayed put.
“Rave,” I said softly, resting my forehead against hers. “You said you
couldn’t live without me. I can’t live without you, either. You don’t want to
be with anyone else. I don’t want to be with anyone else, either. So, why
can’t we be together and make each other happy? Maybe, it’ll only make
me happy initially, but with time, I can make you happy, too. You have to
give this a chance. What do you have to lose if you don’t plan to be with
anyone else?”
Raven said nothing, eyes closed.
She had unfinished business with Ajax. That’s why she didn’t want to
return to this house. Initially, I wanted Raven to face Ajax and ensure it was
truly over between them. However, my intentions have since changed. After
our kiss, I didn’t want to reopen the possibility of her exploring things with
Ajax. She needed a final push to choose me.
Your soulmate knew what to say to make you hate them. They also knew
what to say to make you fall freely into their arms. Everything I was about
to tell her was true, but I had to verbalize her innermost desires in a way
that would resonate.
“Rave, you are my family. You are my everything. If we are together, you’ll
never be alone. I am buying a condo after I come into my trust fund. If we
are in a relationship, we can move in together. Mia also asked to live with
me. We can be a family again. If you decide to be with me, you’ll have
everything you want. If you don’t, you’ll lose everything right now.”
Raven stared with glossy eyes. I could see the wheels turning in her head,
and her body language was complacent. I didn’t waste a second and kissed
her cheek. I pressed another kiss closer to the corner of her mouth. This
time I hovered above her lips, breathing heavily.
Raven looked glazed as I gently kissed her lower lip and lingered. I licked
her bottom lip when Raven finally stirred.
“Reid,” she put one hand on my chest to push me away. I didn’t budge.
“Take some time to think about it,” I said hoarsely. “Use your crazy
analytical skills, the pros and cons list you need to make, and anything else
you need to do. I’ll be gone all day tomorrow. I’ll give you the space you
need. I’m not asking for much here.”
Raven didn’t respond as I kissed her bottom lip again. One of my hands
palmed her face this time while the other pulled her waist to bring her
closer. I kissed her like a maniac, hands sifting through her hair. My tongue
explored her mouth lewdly. Her smell. Her hair. The shape of her body
under my hand. Everything. Everything about this woman drove me crazy
and out of my fucking mind.
A little too soon, Raven broke the kiss. I panted, wanting more. However,
she already gave in, and I couldn’t push her.
“Neither of us wants to be with anyone else, so we have all the time. Just
think about it. It’s not too much to ask for, is it?” I repeated the thought.
Raven shook her head. “No, it’s not,” she sighed. “I’ll think about it, I
promise.”
“Good.” I closed my eyes, letting my forehead fall against hers. I kissed her
gently. “Okay, I’m going to my room before getting any dirty ideas.”
Raven laughed. It was still natural between us. The progression of our
relationship didn’t have to change our dynamic much.
“I’ll see you tomorrow.” I gave her one last kiss. I couldn’t stop kissing her.
Never wanted to stop kissing her again.
“Goodnight, Stud. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Goodnight, Beautiful.”
I strode out of Raven’s room. After years, a weight had been lifted off my
chest. We can do this. Raven would get over her reservations, and I could
remind her why she used to write Mrs. Reid Sinclair in her notebook when
she was little.
A thought occurred to me. I could turn it into a reality. What did I have to
lose? If she agreed to a relationship, I’d end up marrying her. We had
already been together for twenty-two years. I had sowed my wild oats.
Meaningless sex. Endless parties. I was over it. There was only one woman
I wanted to have sex with. There was only one person I wanted to party
with. We could travel the world, get to know each other intimately, and I
could convince her to get married. She could work on her career without
working a part-time job. Raven wouldn’t have a problem with me paying
the bills if it wasn’t Ajax’s money. We were like one person. My money had
always been hers, and everything she had was mine. It was only since Ajax
started supporting me she turned reluctant of my help.
We were already an old married couple. Once I had my job and trust fund, I
could make it our reality. We could live the life I always wanted and make
up for lost time, plus more.
However, there was one thing I needed to take care of first. I had to speak to
Ajax and do right by Raven. I hadn’t even told him about Raven moving
home.
Stepping into my room, I tried Ajax’s cell phone first. No answer. He was
probably busy with work. I racked my brain for what city he might be
currently visiting and sent him a text in case I didn’t receive a callback.
Reid: Hey, bro, heads up. Raven is back in NYC & moving back to the
house. And… I’m going to ask her to be my girlfriend. Long story, but I
think she will say “yes.”
I considered my words, then sent another text. Might as well be open with
Ajax.
Reid: Btw, I need you to pretend like you and Raven never hooked up. She
is feeling awkward enough about it. Yes, I found out about you two. No,
I’m not mad… anymore. But as payback, I am swiping grandma’s ring. I’m
giving her two weeks before popping the question.
MARCH 13TH, 2020.
Reid.
I had planned to stay longer on campus to finish my errands.
However, Mia texted me, asking me to come home. Ajax was home early
and asked Mia to gather everyone.
Our house would be packed at capacity over the next few weeks. Uncle
John and Theressa moved back to the USA. They were in Boston, gathering
their remaining belongings from their storage unit. They were arriving
today as well.
Ajax wanted to discuss living arrangements since so many people would
live together.
Whatever.
Hailing a cab, I made my way home, excited about my future possibilities
with Raven.
Years of waiting led to this damn day, and it couldn’t come soon enough. I
should have picked a better date than Friday, the 13th. The date was
auspicious, though I was optimistic.
It might be selfish to twist Raven’s arm into a relationship, and in the
beginning, a romantic relationship between us would only make me happy.
However, I was optimistic she’d warm to the idea over time. I could break
down her walls and show her we could have the kind of love she dreamt
about; Unconditional.
When the driver pulled up to the house, I sprinted out of the cab. Stepping
through the front door, I found Mia charging toward me.
“There you are.” Mia jumped into my arms.
“Hey, sis.” I gave her a quick hug. “Where is Raven?”
“She must still be at work,” Mia looked at the time on her phone. “Ajax
wanted to figure out the living arrangements. We have never had so many
people living in the house before.”
“I know. Where is everyone else?”
“We just picked up the Becketts. They are upstairs in the guest room,
unpacking. Mom and Dad are in the kitchen. I saw Ajax’s jacket on the
living room chair, so I am guessing he is in his room.”
“Alright, let’s go see him. Grab Mom and Dad. I’ll grab the Becketts.”
Mia went to the kitchen to grab my parents. I walked upstairs to find the
Becketts in the guest room, and after exchanging pleasantries, we
congregated at the top of the stairs.
Ajax still hadn’t come out of his room, so we decided to walk to his room
instead.
Raven hadn’t come home from work yet, which was odd. I bet she was still
trying to avoid Ajax for as long as possible.
We made our way through the narrow hallway and turned the corner. Mom
was about to knock on the door when everyone stopped short as Ajax’s door
flew open.
We expected Ajax to pop out, but someone else came out from behind the
door instead.
Raven.
Wrapped in nothing but a bedsheet and naked underneath, Raven stood at
Ajax’s door frame, and right behind her was Ajax in an equally
compromising position.
MOTHERFUCKER!
